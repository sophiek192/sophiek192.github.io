							<h2>About me:</h2>
							<p> I distinctly remember my first CSESoc event. Sitting in the CLB for Peer Mentoring Kick-Off and I  smiled at someone walking up the stairs, who I shortly became friends with. [A few terms later, we endured 1531 together ü§£]<br>

								<br> Throughout the past two years, I've been lucky enough to witness, assist and feel the impact CSESoc has on the community. <br>
								
								<br> Since then, you've probably seen me helping out at events, grabbing a sausage at our weekly bbqs or my weekly Peer Mentoring announcements üòÖ. I believe this society has facilitated my own growth, alongside so many others, of which I hope to continue achieving next year as an exec üå±. 
								Below are what I hope to achieve in the coming year!!

						<h2>‚≠ê Empowering the community:</h2>
						<p>Assisting the personal growth of students, socially, academically and professionally.</p>
						<li>More opportunities to <b>develop professionally </b>though having more career-related events such as technical workshops, mock interviews, site visits, networking opportunities, or careers fairs üßë‚Äçüíª</li>
						<li>Promoting and <b>improving the quality</b> of our current programs - e.g Having check ups with students within the Peer/Industry Mentoring Program</li>
						<li>Ensuring that these events, programs, and content are <b>accessible</b> to the community e.g Promoting the Financial Accessibility Scheme or <b>greater marketing</b> for current programs to ensure people know the opportunities available.</li>

							<h2>‚òÅÔ∏è Supporting the overall wellbeing of students:</h2>
							<p>Wellbeing comes in many forms, including physical, mental, intellectual, social and spiritual. I‚Äôd hope to place a greater focus on these  areas holistically through:<br>
								<li>Providing <b>greater definition of the Socials</b> Portfolio. At the present, it primarily is targeting social health and occasionally physical. Establishing a focus on wellbeing will hopefully provide greater direction for next year.</li>
								<li><b>Content</b> that authentically displays how each factor impacts students and the importance of prioritising ones wellbeing e.g Short informative snip-its/Vox Pops on tiktok/reels/youtube shorts</li>
								<li>Ensuring that there is a <b>variety</b> of events and content being produced. Doing so would ensure that we different people with different interests can gain something from CSESoc. E.g Collaborating with different societies, unis.</li>

						<p>CSESoc is a society for the people. By implementing feedback meaningfully, we are able to ensure that the events, merchandise and content produced by CSESoc meets the wants of the community.<br>

							<li>Asking for opinions + suggestions from the community<b> whilst planning</b> e.g What sort of resources/content are desired</li>

							<h2>üó∫Ô∏è Journey in CSESoc: </h2>
							<p>In 2021, I was a subcom member of the Student Experience (studex) portfolio - creating events for different target groups within the CSE and wider UNSW community. This year, alongside Anish and Ella, we were able to bring so many events, that had never been done before, to life with the help of our Socials subcom ü•∫!! <br>
